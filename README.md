============
HOPD-Minimal
============

A minimal implementation of the HOPD API which demostrates the use of the EhrScape API (dev.ehrscape.com) in use with 2 different URL endpoints, both served by openEHR-based patient information repositories with completley different technology stacks. The data format and querying is based on the semantics defined in openEHR archetypes and is therefore system and technology independent.
